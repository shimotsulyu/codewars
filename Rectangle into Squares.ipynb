    "- lng == wdth as a starting case would be an entirely different problem and the drawing is planned to be interpreted with lng != wdth. (See kata, Square into Squares. Protect trees! http://www.codewars.com/kata/54eb33e5bc1a25440d000891 for this problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the initial parameters are so that lng == wdth, the solution [lng] would be the most obvious but not in the spirit of this kata so, in that case, return None/nil/null/Nothing or return {} with C++, Array() with Scala, [] with Raku.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In that case the returned structure of C will have its sz component equal to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Return the string \"nil\" with Bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran."
