    "In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.\n",
    "\n",
    "The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a \"good\" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a \"bad\" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.\n",
