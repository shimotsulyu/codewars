    "John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.\n",
    "\n",
    "John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John?\n",
    "\n",
    "Task\n",
    "Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "> wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return \"ten\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return \"zero\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers); it can happens that w * h * l is zero\n",
    "\n",
    "- the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20\n",
    "\n",
    "- FORTH: the number of rolls will be a positive or null integer (not a plain English word; this number can be greater than 20)\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Javascript English numbers are preloaded and can be accessed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> numbers = [\"zero\", \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\", \"seven\", \"eight\", \"nine\", \"ten\", \"eleven\", \"twelve\",\"thirteen\", \"fourteen\", \"fifteen\", \"sixteen\", \"seventeen\", \"eighteen\", \"nineteen\", \"twenty\"]\n",
    "For other languages it is not preloaded but you can use the above one if you need it."
